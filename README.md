## Background

As a group project Just Choose was created as a fun way to make group decisions.

Deciding where to eat is difficult, Just Choose allows one person to provide a shortlist of restaurants, and provide the list for participants to vote on their choice.

Below we have provided a test username/password for demo purposes:

```
Username: test@just-choose.com
Password: Qwerty!
```

Feel free to create your own account if you prefer. Passwords are hashed with [Bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) before being stored in the database.

Just Choose is a React frontend web application that interacts with a MongoDb/Express backend, written in TypeScript.
